                    <h2>1. Extended Learning Approach</h2>
                    <p>Through this course, I have gained a deep understanding of the profound impact of cloud technology and digital innovation on modern business and society. Not only did it help me expand my technical knowledge, but it also made me realize the importance of systematic and critical thinking when facing complex problems. In order to consolidate my understanding, I adopted more efficient learning methods, such as creating diagrams and visual notes using key points from the course handouts, which greatly improved my ability to remember and apply complex concepts.</p>

                    <h2>2. Time Management and Focus Improvement</h2>
                    <p>During my studies, I tried various time management strategies, such as studying at a fixed time. This method helped me stay focused when dealing with difficult technical content and improved my overall learning efficiency. I found that allocating my time wisely not only ensured my deep understanding of the content, but also helped me cope with multiple tasks in parallel.</p>

                    <h2>3. Critical Thinking and Interdisciplinary Applications</h2>
                    <p>Issues such as artificial intelligence, cloud technology and the responsibilities of digital citizenship were explored in the course, which prompted me to start thinking about the social and ethical implications behind technology. In particular, when discussing the social impact of AI and automated systems, I realized that it is not enough to master the technology, but I also need to have an interdisciplinary perspective to assess the application and impact of technology in different contexts. This has made me focus more on moral responsibility and social values in my learning process.</p>

                    <h2>4. Cooperation and Teamwork</h2>
                    <p>During the cooperation in group projects, I learned how to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts in a team. Especially during the time when I was sick, team members took the initiative to take up part of my tasks, which made me deeply realize the importance of responsibility and support in teamwork. At the same time, the discussions and disagreements in the team made me realize that different perspectives can stimulate innovative ideas, and a respectful and tolerant team atmosphere can help the project move forward better!</p>

                    <p>Through this study and practice, I have not only mastered the application of more cutting-edge technologies, but also developed a more rigorous way of thinking and a sense of responsibility. I hope to continue to explore the fields of cloud technology and artificial intelligence in the future and apply these technologies to solve real-world problems. I have also become more aware that as an IT professional, I not only need to focus on technological innovation, but also need to consider the social impact and ethical responsibility of technology, which will play an important role in my future career.</p>
